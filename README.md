# spread.awk

This AWK source provides a set of defaults for creating spreadsheets in
plain text documents. To include this functionality into your own
application, use "awk -f" multiple times, including **this** source first. I
recall that Gawk, in particular, has a "source" command that behaves like sh's
-- you could use that, too, I suppose.

I dedicate this code to the public domain, since it's so trivial.
